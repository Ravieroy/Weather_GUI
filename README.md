## Weather_GUI
----

GUI for Weather data using python and Tkinter module. This uses the API from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/). If for some reason the API doesn't work, simply replace the existing api key with your own. The key can be obtained free from the mentioned website.

To run the program without worrying about the dependencies use the executable file. If on running it throws error, simply do ***chmod u+x frontend_weather*** to give the file execute permissions and them it should run fine. Feel free to adapt the source code and make it better. 

The code for the GUI part is coded in frontend_weather.py and the backend part is done in backend_weather.py. A database named cities.db is provided and atleast one entry in the database is required to be present for the executable/program to run. I couldn't make it work without it. You can them delete/add new cities into the database.
